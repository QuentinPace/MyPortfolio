# Welcome to MyPortfolio 

I built this project using **TypeScript** and **React** to take advantage of their flexibility and scalability. I chose TypeScript because I hadnâ€™t worked with it before and wanted to challenge myself while benefiting from its type safety. React felt like the perfect choice to make the site modular and easy to maintain as my portfolio grows.

I designed the project to separate the portfolio details from the implementation code. This way, updating my portfolio is straightforward, and it also turns the site into a reusable template for other developers who might need a portfolio shell.

Overall, this project is a one-stop shop for all my professional details and showcases a clean, modular approach to creating a personal website.
