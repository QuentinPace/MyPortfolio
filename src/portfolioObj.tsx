    aLittleBitAboutMe: "Hello! I'm Quentin Pace, a passionate software engineer based in Warsaw, Indiana, with a background rooted in the fast-paced culinary world. Before transitioning to tech, I developed leadership, precision, and a strong work ethic managing kitchens—skills I now bring to every software project. My journey into development began with completing the intensive full-stack program at App Academy, where I gained a solid foundation in modern technologies. As a developer, I combine creativity and attention to detail to deliver high-quality results. Outside of coding, I enjoy pushing my limits at the gym, improving my golf swing, and making lasting memories with my little one. I'm open to remote work or relocation and eager to collaborate with teams that value passion, growth, and innovation. Let's connect and build something exceptional together!",

Fast forward to today, that curiosity has grown into a full pursuit of success in software development. From a kid with a dream to a determined developer, this journey has been all about growth, learning, and turning passion into reality.",
